This can be because we happen to have to solve a specific problem or this is just the way a coder evolves. How could coders save ideas that pop up during this solving and learning process? Coder Evolution provides a service that makes it easy for coders to edit, preview and save [Markdown Texts](https://www.markdownguide.org/) where their great ideas live.\n\n---\n\nCoded with üç∫ by [Earvin Li](https://github.com/earvinLi)`;
